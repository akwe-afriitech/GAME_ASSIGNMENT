In this game, players take on the role of a cave man who must navigate through a series of cells to escape while avoiding a relentless
monster and poisonous cells that reduce their health points. The objective is to successfully exit the game to emerge as the winner.
This documentation outlines the game's features, gameplay mechanics, and instructions for customization and future development.

Game Overview:
Escape from the Monster is a text-based adventure game where players control a cave man character trapped in a grid of cells,
representing the game world. The goal is to reach the exit cell while avoiding encounters with a monster and poison cells. The game is presented through console input and output.

Features and Gameplay Mechanics:

Grid and Cells:
The game world is represented as a grid of cells. Each cell can be empty, contain the player, the exit, the monster, or poisonous cells.
The grid is displayed in the console, providing a visual representation of the player's progress.

Player Movement:
Players can move their cave man character one cell at a time in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They use simple commands such as "up,"
"down," "left," and "right" to navigate through the grid.

Monster:
The monster moves randomly from cell to cell in the grid. If the player and the monster occupy the same cell, the player loses the game.
The monster's movements add an element of unpredictability and challenge to the gameplay.

Poison Cells:
Certain cells in the grid are poisonous. If the player enters a poison cell, their health points decrease. Accumulating too much poison damage can lead to defeat
. Players must strategize their movements to avoid these cells.

Health Points:
The player starts with a certain number of health points. Entering poison cells deducts a specific amount of health.
The player must carefully manage their health and avoid encounters with the monster and poison cells to stay alive and win the game.

Exit Cell:
The game objective is to reach the exit cell, which signifies a successful escape. Once the player reaches the exit cell without encountering the monster or poison cells,
they win the game.

Development and Customization:

The Cave Man Game: Escape from the Monster is developed using the C++ programming language. The code structure employs concepts such as grids,
player movement, and randomization for monster behavior. Developers can customize and extend the game based on specific requirements or desired features. 
Potential areas for future development include:

Game Difficulty Levels: Introduce different difficulty levels with varying grid sizes, monster speeds, and poison cell densities to provide
players with more challenging gameplay options.

Power-ups and Bonuses: Implement power-up items that restore health points, increase movement speed, or provide temporary invincibility to the player,
enhancing their chances of success.

Score and Leaderboards: Add a scoring system to track players' performance and implement leaderboards to foster competition among players.

Visual Enhancements: Incorporate graphical elements, sound effects, and animations to enhance the game's visual appeal and immersion.

Conclusion:

The Cave Man Game: Escape from the Monster offers an engaging text-based adventure where players must navigate through a grid of cells,
avoiding a monster and poisonous cells while striving to reach the exit cell. Through strategic movement, careful planning, and resource management,
